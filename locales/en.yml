        ### What is this?

        It is an online platform to make super easy for indie game developers to receive videos from their playtesters sessions.

        ### Why should I use it?

        Watching players playing your game is the best way to understand how/when/how much do they engage with your creation.

        ### Why only desktop games?

        We want to specialize on desktop games so we are sure we do one thing good. When we manage to do this we will think about adopting other devices.

        ### Is the platform ready?

        No yet, we are in development, if you are interested in knowing more [subscribe to our mailing list](./subscribe.html) or [contact us](mailto:hello@playcocola.com) directly.

        ### Can I make suggestions?

        Yes please: [contact us](mailto:hello@playcocola.com)
